# Mainproject-
*Prediction of User Behavior in Social Networks*

The main objective of our project is to predict the state of mind of the users by analyzing their chats in social networks using NLP and Machine learning Techniques

Here we can propose 
            The proposed system incorporates single words, sentences,  paragraphs, voice  and audio file analysis. 
Using NLP techniques such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic modelling will  gain a deeper understanding of the content and sentiment of the text. 
Rule-based, machine learning-based, and aspect-based approaches will enable to prediction of the sentiment of the text, which can be helpful for understanding how users are feeling about particular topics or issues.
 Here we use LSVC and LSTM machine learning algorithms to predict user behaviour based on their texts in social networks.

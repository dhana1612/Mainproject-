#Prediction of User Behavior in Social Networks
**Objective**
The main objective of our project is to predict the state of mind of the users by analyzing their chats in social networks using NLP and Machine learning Techniques

**INTRODUCTION**:
The number of social networking sites or social media users has increased significantly over the last decade.
User behaviour Prediction  involves the use of Natural language processing techniques to develop models for sentiment analysis, using publicly available datasets of social media posts and messages.
These models will be trained to recognize different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral and behaviors like clever, crime, short-temper, friendly, helpful, etc. and will be tested on real-world data from social networks. 
It has several potential applications, including early detection of mental health issues, personalized treatment, online safety, and improved policing strategies.
